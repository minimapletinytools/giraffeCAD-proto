# Coordinate System
GiraffeCAD uses a right-hand coordinate system.

- XY is the "ground" and Z is "up" 

- +X/-x is also "right"/"left"
- +Y/-Y is also "forward"/"back"
- +Z/-Z is also "up"/"down" or "top"/"bottom"


## Features
We will refer to the following geometric concepts and their corresponding physical features

- Point / Vertex
- Line / Edge
- Plane / Face

Since faces live on solid objects, they are "sided" objects:

- we say 2 faces are *oriented* if they share the same normal, and *opposite* if their normals are opposites
