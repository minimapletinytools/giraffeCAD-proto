1. determine the end the top lap timber based on top_lap_shoulder_position_from_top_lap_shoulder_timber_end and lap_length
2. project the end position onto bottom_lap_timber
3. create half plane cuts to remove the end
4. determine the orientation of the lap based on top_lap_timber_face
5. in the axis orthogonal to top_lap_timber_face find where the 2 laps meet based on lap_deth
6. create prisms to remove the material from each timber resp
7. union with the half lap cuts we created earlier and return the CSG pair

we want to generaize name/parent so we can build ahirerachy, 
there is one special distiction which is that there are Construction and Concept names, Construction maps to actual objects or are used to organize actual objects. Concepts map to things like joints and features

I guess for now just mash them all together but flag them as such. when rendering in something that doesn't support concepts, just omit them, or we can extract concepts into a sepaarte tree but use the same hierarchy (if they were parented to a construction, then just create ap roxy for the construction in the concept tree)

:: 1/8/2026 reference dimension helper classes

measuring functions should look like this:

```
measure_from_some_feature(
  timber_to_reference,
  timber_to_mark,
  reference_feature_on_timber_to_reference,
  measurement_relative_to_reference_feature_on_timber_to_reference_local,
) -> measurement_in_timber_to_mark_local_space
```
for example:
```
timber_cross_section_size_from_reference_long_faces(
    timber_to_reference,
    timber_to_mark, 
    x_face: Optional[LongFace]
    y_face: Optional[LongFace]
    size: V2
) -> size_in_timber_to_mark_xy_local_space
# so (x,y) would have x in the x_face axis and/or y in the y_face axis of timber_to_reference
# only valid if these faces are adjacent
# you typically only want to specify 1 of these faces and the other one is inferred but nothing is stopping you from specifying both
```


sometimes we also want to take reference_feature_on_timber_to_mark and in this case, the returned measurement is relative to reference_feature_on_timber_to_mark. Of course this may only make sense in some cases, in particular that the feature in both cases share the same "basis".

let's make sharing the same basis concrete.

We use the feature definition in concepts.md

first declare the feature e.g. some long edge on a timber (we treat edges as infinite lines)
next restrict the basis e.g. measuring on some face (plane) of the timber
at this stage, we need to do some *magic* to determine the sign of the basis, so if we're measuring on a face of some timber from an edge, then positive is obviously measuring away from the edge onto the face.
for multidimensional basis, we always go x -> y -> z in that order
sometimes the reference timber and mark timber share a basis but have different signs, in this case, the measurement is taking in the reference timbers basis, and then returned in the mark timber basis obviously.
sometimes (often) the basis match but the measurements don't overlap in global space, in this case, project the point orthogonally from 1 basis to the other (TODO need to define this more rigorously, basis is insufficient, we are really talking about a distance in space relative to either a line (1D) or a point (2D) in a plane, in which case we can project to another plane that's parallel (or perhaps better to treat it as a plane/line in space that we intersect with another plane? nah)
or we might be takling about a measurement in an axis or plane (for sizes), in which case no project is needed

Here are some example of feature + basis 

-size on face
-distance from long edge on long face
-distance from end face on centerline
-distance from shoulder plane on centerline (this gets converted to distance from end face internally)


examples of things we want to do

-using join timbers, we want to set lateral offest such that the outside face of the created timber is inset from the outside face of the timber to be joined:
  -how do we do this, the created timber doesn't exist yet???

-position a rafter such that the bottom of of the rafter is 1 inch away from top of the beam
  -same issue as above...

https://chatgpt.com/share/695e878b-da08-800c-a658-6913d1b54ee0

Main challenge:

- allow metadata to be attached to CSG... we want to do this per face which is tricky... as we don't have a good way to identify features in our CSG geometry.... I guess you mainly want "surfaces as result of this difference" or perhaps "surfaces with this normal at this position"

so the next step is acutally to do a CSG expansion

-allow contains_point and boundary to return none, as we will add shapes that can't easily be computed
-allow metadata to be defined on CSG primitives (HARD)
  -primitives define surfaces
  -surfaces must be "preserved" through unions and differences
  -come up with examples to see if this covers our use cases:
    -prism -> timber
    -diff prism -> tenon
    -half plane cut -> shoulder plane
  -would be cool to also mark edges and vertices
-I think the above is doable without embedding info in the meshes, you would just need to have a set of filters (and bounding volumes) to check if some edge/tri matches some feature and we can do this using normals and boundary checks etc
-add MeowMeowCSGMesh class and add to_csg_mesh function 
  -hard part, as we also need to add metadata to the mesh
  -I think metadata can be injected based on

### PEGS
pegs (could be round or rectangular), rectangular pegs can be inserted at an angle
class RoundPeg
class RectangularPeg:
    size1: Numeric # consistent rule of which axis this is w.r.t to the tenon timber
    size2: Numeric # consistent rule of which axis this is w.r.t to the tenon timber
    rotation: angle in degrees # clockwise rotation when looking at the peg from the insertion side
pegs are always orthogonal to the length axis of the 2 timbers, but they can go in from either side, specified 


QUESTION how to handle peg orientation. do we allow rotating in all idrections? should we make a separat function for tusk tenon  which may want the tenon running lengthwise with the mrotise timber

ANSWER: most generic version is that peg is defined somewhere in the tenon timber, lets oriented in the length axis by default. and then an orientation is applied...

SOLUTION: make a peg class with helpers...

class Peg:
  # peg is always stored in local space of a timber, so identity orientation has peg pointing in the same direction as the length axis of the timber (with the insertion end at the bottom)
  orientation: orientation
  position: V3
  size: Numeric
  shape: square|round 

class PegShape
  size
  shape

create_peg_going_into_face(timber: Timber, face: TimberLongFace, distance_from_bot: Numeric, distance_from_centerline: Numeric, peg_shape : PegShape)


## wedges
wedges are little triangle (with tip cut) pieces of wood going into the tenon end to wedge it in place. 

class wedge:
  # in local space fo the timber, a identity orientation has the point end of the wedge going in the length direction of the timber. 
  # the profile of the wedge (which looks like a triangle with the tip cut off) in the Y axis. Thus thickness is in the y axis
  # teh width of the wedge is in the X axis
  # the 0,0 point of the wedge is at the bottom center of the longer side of the triangle

:: 12/29/2025 mortise and tenon notes



this function is very generic and does a bunch of things. in particluar we want the following variants which will all call into this function;

      -mortise and tenon
      -through mortise and tenon
      -wedged mortise and tenon
      -wedged through mortise and tenon
      -fox wedge mortise and tenon
      -draw bore mortise and tenon
      -Hōzo-zashi Komisen-dome (ほぞ差し込み栓止め)
        -same as draw bore but with komisen peg,
      -tusked mortise and tenon 


for now, create the super generic 

cut_mortise_and_tenon_many_options_do_not_call_me_directly

then do simple_mortise_and_tenon function that has no pegs or wedges

the cut_mortise_and_tenon_many_options_do_not_call_me_directly function, it should take the following parameters

-tenon timber
-mortise timber
-tenon end (of the tenon timber)
-size (X,Y cross sectional size of tenon in local space of the tenon timber)
-tenon_length
-mortise_depth (must be >= to tenon length, if none, then it's a through mortise)
-tenon_rotation (ccw rotation of tenon, identity by default )
-wedges parameters (optional)
-peg parameters (otpional)


for implemntation, for now, assert on wedge and peg parameters being none, we will implement them later. also assert tenon_rotation is identity.


stub out the peg and wedge praameter classes below though

class SimplePegParameters
  shape: PegShape
  tenon_face: TimberLongFace # the face on the TENON timber that the pegs will be perpendicular too, only valid if tenon_rotation is identity
  peg_positions: [(Numeric, Numeric)] # first is in length axis measured from the shoulder of the tenon, the second is in the perpendicular axis measured from center
  depth: Optinoal[Numeric] # measured from mortise face where the peg goes in, none means peg goes all the way through to the other side
  length: length of the peg

class WedgeParameters
  shape: Wedge Shape
  depth: Numeric # depth of the wedge cut, note could be different than length of wedge
  width_axis: Direction3D # wedges run along this axis, so the, so when looking perpendicular to this and the length axis, you see the the trapezoidal "sides" of the wedges
  positions: [Numeric] # positions from center of the timber in the width axis
  expand_mortise: Numeric # amount to fan out the bottom of the mortise to fit the wedges, so 0 means straight sides, and X means expand both sides of the mortise bottom by X (total) from straight. 0 by default

::12/2025 BREP CUTTING OPERATIONS

make a generic B-rep cutting operations for doing most joints:

-very basic
  -shoulder plane 
    -specified by a position and a normal (infintie plane)
    -created relative to a timber end + direction
  -rectangular prism
    -easy for tenon ends
    -for mortises, do we use the joining timber to locate? Probably not,



Challenges:
- locating rectangular prisms from tenon and mortises
- infinet to finite bounds



:: 12/2025 timber joint rep and  timber length calculatino notes

-cut
  -substractive operation on timber
  -end cuts "set" the length of the timber (either extending it or shortening it) on the end it cut
    -ALTERNATIVE 
      -cut does not care, just does substractive cut. (this is kinda nice)
      -add suppor for infinite timbers (this is really nice)
      -unjointed end cuts can either 
        -be non infinte timber ends (a little ad-hoc)
        -we could use an end cut operation to size the timber (pro) (cumbersome, but most elegant)
  -if cutting on the bot (origin) end, the origin remains in the same place, so the final cut timber has a bottom point below 0
    -ALTERNATIVE: move origin to the very bottom always (ick?)

DECISION
  -timbers defined as is (with origin and length)
  -when a timber has a cut at the end, it becomes infinite in that direction
  -if it helps, you can think of timbers without an end cut as an infinite timber with a default end cut at the length
  
-joint
  -cuts on 1 ore more timbers that connect them


-Cut 
  -implementation detail (sorta)
  -happen at the CSG/brep level
  -if we do the extension thing
    -extending timber end includes cut
    -I guess could/should be used to infer timber length if we go with the "extension" method
  -TODO how are cuts defined, relative to timber origin or relative to a point/face on the timber?
    -maybe relative to timber, in which case a Cut class on its own is meaningless, maybe was well define TimberCut and then [TimberCut] for a list of cuts on a timber (at which point maybe just name it Cut)
-TimberCut
  -A timber with a series of Cuts on it
  -if we do the extension thing
    -has some face-cognition, meaning cuts happen relative to a face,  (this actualy only need)
      -only ends can be "extended", this is very much an ad-hoc operation
-Joint
  -a list of TimberCuts that form the joint
  -also includes joint accesories like draw bore,s fasteners, etc
-CutTimber
  -A timber with a list of TimberCuts?  


:: 11/2025 Reference Stuff

we want to introduce some kind of notion of "ReferencePoint/Line/Plane" for the purpose of positioning timbers relative to each other.
We'll call these classes "ReferenceFeature" 

For example:

I want to create 3 timbers like so:

      
      |
A-----|
  |   |
  |   |
  B   C  


so in this case, we want to use `join_timbers` and align it such that:
- the top face of timber A align with the top face of timber B
- the vertical position set above determines where it will connect with timber C



In general, we want to be able to take a ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber and position that relative to another ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber

We support the following ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber

Timber Vertex  -> ReferencePoint
Timber Edge -> ReferenceLine
Timber Face -> ReferencePlane
Timber Centerline -> ReferenceLine
Timber Face + Timber Centerline -> ReferencePoint



Lets look at the current signature of join_timbers:

def join_timbers(timber1: Timber, timber2: Timber, 
                location_on_timber1: float,
                location_on_timber2: Optional[float] = None,
                lateral_offset: float = Integer(0),
                stickout: Stickout = None,  # Defaults to Stickout.nostickout()
                size: Optional[V2] = None,
                orientation_width_vector: Optional[Direction3D] = None) -> Timber:

In this case we want to be able to do the general positioning instead of just location_on_timber1

There are some limitations since we only have 1 DOF for positioning, in particular we must position against either the Reference Plane that is the top or bottom Face of timber1
In this case, the ReferenceFeature of Timber1 also carries an implicit direction argument, but perhaps we may as well imbue Reference Features with a direction vector? The direction vector must always be perpendicular to the line/plane. 
By convention, the directional vector coming out of an vertex/edge will be perpendicular to one of the faces that the vertex/edge lives on

For the ReferenceFeature of the created timber, it could be:

ReferencePoint
ReferenceLine/Plane that is parallel with ReferencePlane of timber 1




:: 11/2025 DONE Stickout

by default, join timbers joins between midline of timbers but often we want to join from the outside, so we should add modes to the stickout class like

stickoutReference1 / stickoutReference2

enum StickoutReference = CENTER_LINE | INSIDE | OUTSIDE


CENTER_LINE
joined timber
| |
||===== createdtimber
| |

INSIDE
joined timber
| |
| |===== createdtimber
| |

OUTSIDE
joined timber
| |
|====== createdtimber
| |


Also we should probbal yrename join_timbers to refere to timber1/2 as timberA/B instead
