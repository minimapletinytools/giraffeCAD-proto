-fix create_axis_aligned_horizontal_timber_on_footprint
    lets update the create_axis_aligned_horizontal_timber_on_footprint function

    for the # Position based on location type, you need to do the following:

    - first determine the "corner shape" by comparing the neighboring footprint points
    - determine whether it is an inside corner  or an outside corner
    - if the footprint locatino type is INSIDE .... 

-support for non axis/face aligned/ non orthogonal timbers? (so you can do things like 60 degree joints for delta printer lol)
    -support center axis offsets only yay
