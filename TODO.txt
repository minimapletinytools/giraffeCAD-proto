:: TODO

DONE-see if you can fix the transform issue in fusion360...  should be able to do as rigid joint with origin
  FAIL-in fusion 360, hwen transforming occurences (components) to their final position.. rather than setting transform2. instead can you create a rigid joint with the global origin to set the position instead. 
  DONE-just do the body move way...
DONE-freecad
  DONE-clean up the run_ freecad stuff so it's more consist and easy to switch between examples
  DONE-add accesory rendering to freecad
DONE-add basic extrude profiles to CSG
DONE-update oscar shed to use mortise and tenon joint
DONE-mortise hole calculation is incorrect please fix
DONE-add Frame class to timber.py 
  -add a check_no_floats method that checks that all the contents of the frame are using sympy rationals, NO FLOATS
  -assert on the check_no_floats method in the ctor to ensure no floats are in the frame
  -update all examples to output frames
  -update fusino360 and freecad to take a frame object
  -get rid of PartiallyCutTimber class while you're at it
DONE-rewrite all joint tests, they are all kinda messed up tbh

-improve tests
  DONE-fix is_point_on_boundary, it's not working... maybe add some tests for it...
  DONE-buttjoints
    IGNORE-fix nearest_point_on_face_to_point_global and uncomment the test
  -mortise and tenon joint
    -fix the T shape orientatin, it's all fucked up right now 
    -peg forward_length / stickout depth tests
    -peg_depth = none case, ensure it's picking the right axis to use for computing peg depth
    -peg orientation should be perpendicular to tenon timber
    -test points in peg hole do not line in timber/mortise csg
    -test points in peg hole do lie on the peg CSG
    -test mortise depth and tenon depth using CSG test functions

  

-add a Frame.from_joints function, it sohuld also take a list of timbers as well. Uses referential equality to test for same timbers. Also checks for same name, and if same name but different reference, check for deep equality and warn if they are the same also warn on same names
-add back post joints to oscar shed


-add more features to mortise and tenon joint
  -add offset mortise peg param (so that it tightens the joint up)
  -support non face aligned cases
    -clean up the mortise shoulder calculation shit wtf or maybe yo uneed it for non face aligned cases?
  -extract out peg creation stuff, it will be useful in other places
    -basically, just figure out the start point and direction of the peg... it will return to you a tuple of prisms to substract from the mortise and tenon timber, and a peg accessory
  -add additinoal mortise timbers to mortise tenon joint.. so you can do the thing like the stacked joint on the back post of oscarshed
    -actually better to do this as a house joint and 2 separate mortise and tenon joints. the second mortise and tenon joint will be awkard but it works so why not

-add extrude polygon csg rendering to fusino 360

  -update docs
    -cleanup README
      -clean up venv/makefile/setup nonsense so its simpler...
    -cleanup comments in code and delete morenotes.md
    -generate docs
    - you need a better way to specify timber lenghts... most of the time you don't really care? It should be determined by the joint in most cases.
      - so I guess joints will resize the timber, even tusk tenon joints take a tusk length parameter, tenon joints have a tenon depth parameter etc.. 
      - i think this is how it already is, update the README to explain this
    - move joint section from morenotes into concepts.md and then delete morenotes

:: FUTURE shit
-should I make a "block" class that parents "Timber" and then make a "board" class?
-should we attach meta info to Timbers, it would be nice if timbers were aware of their location on the footprint to assist in finding reference faces for joint operations
- add nominal_size sup port for square and line rule desgins
- make really awesome examples that showcase each parameter of each function

### PEGS
pegs (could be round or rectangular), rectangular pegs can be inserted at an angle
class RoundPeg
class RectangularPeg:
    size1: Numeric # consistent rule of which axis this is w.r.t to the tenon timber
    size2: Numeric # consistent rule of which axis this is w.r.t to the tenon timber
    rotation: angle in degrees # clockwise rotation when looking at the peg from the insertion side
pegs are always orthogonal to the length axis of the 2 timbers, but they can go in from either side, specified 


QUESTION how to handle peg orientation. do we allow rotating in all idrections? should we make a separat function for tusk tenon  which may want the tenon running lengthwise with the mrotise timber

ANSWER: most generic version is that peg is defined somewhere in the tenon timber, lets oriented in the length axis by default. and then an orientation is applied...

SOLUTION: make a peg class with helpers...

class Peg:
  # peg is always stored in local space of a timber, so identity orientation has peg pointing in the same direction as the length axis of the timber (with the insertion end at the bottom)
  orientation: orientation
  position: V3
  size: Numeric
  shape: square|round 

class PegShape
  size
  shape

create_peg_going_into_face(timber: Timber, face: TimberLongFace, distance_from_bot: Numeric, distance_from_centerline: Numeric, peg_shape : PegShape)


## wedges
wedges are little triangle (with tip cut) pieces of wood going into the tenon end to wedge it in place. 

class wedge:
  # in local space fo the timber, a identity orientation has the point end of the wedge going in the length direction of the timber. 
  # the profile of the wedge (which looks like a triangle with the tip cut off) in the Y axis. Thus thickness is in the y axis
  # teh width of the wedge is in the X axis
  # the 0,0 point of the wedge is at the bottom center of the longer side of the triangle

  orientation: ORientation
  position: V3
  base_width: Numeric
  tip_width: numeric
  thickness: Numeric

:: 12/29/2025 mortise and tenon notes



this function is very generic and does a bunch of things. in particluar we want the following variants which will all call into this function;

      -mortise and tenon
      -through mortise and tenon
      -wedged mortise and tenon
      -wedged through mortise and tenon
      -fox wedge mortise and tenon
      -draw bore mortise and tenon
      -Hōzo-zashi Komisen-dome (ほぞ差し込み栓止め)
        -same as draw bore but with komisen peg,
      -tusked mortise and tenon 


for now, create the super generic 

cut_mortise_and_tenon_many_options_do_not_call_me_directly

then do simple_mortise_and_tenon function that has no pegs or wedges

the cut_mortise_and_tenon_many_options_do_not_call_me_directly function, it should take the following parameters

-tenon timber
-mortise timber
-tenon end (of the tenon timber)
-size (X,Y cross sectional size of tenon in local space of the tenon timber)
-tenon_length
-mortise_depth (must be >= to tenon length, if none, then it's a through mortise)
-tenon_rotation (ccw rotation of tenon, identity by default )
-wedges parameters (optional)
-peg parameters (otpional)


for implemntation, for now, assert on wedge and peg parameters being none, we will implement them later. also assert tenon_rotation is identity.


stub out the peg and wedge praameter classes below though

class SimplePegParameters
  shape: PegShape
  tenon_face: TimberLongFace # the face on the TENON timber that the pegs will be perpendicular too, only valid if tenon_rotation is identity
  peg_positions: [(Numeric, Numeric)] # first is in length axis measured from the shoulder of the tenon, the second is in the perpendicular axis measured from center
  depth: Optinoal[Numeric] # measured from mortise face where the peg goes in, none means peg goes all the way through to the other side
  length: length of the peg

class WedgeParameters
  shape: Wedge Shape
  depth: Numeric # depth of the wedge cut, note could be different than length of wedge
  width_axis: Direction3D # wedges run along this axis, so the, so when looking perpendicular to this and the length axis, you see the the trapezoidal "sides" of the wedges
  positions: [Numeric] # positions from center of the timber in the width axis
  expand_mortise: Numeric # amount to fan out the bottom of the mortise to fit the wedges, so 0 means straight sides, and X means expand both sides of the mortise bottom by X (total) from straight. 0 by default




:: 12/24/2025 reorg code notes


all core code should live in a "code_goes_here" folder
tests should exists side by side to code (not in their separate test folder)

-timber.py cotains all enums constants and types
-construction.py contains all our timber creation functions
-basic_joints.py contains all basic joint creation functions
-giraffe.py imports all files and rexports them together

don't touch fusion360, rhino, examples, oldcrap folder for now



::12/2025 BREP CUTTING OPERATIONS

make a generic B-rep cutting operations for doing most joints:

-very basic
  -shoulder plane 
    -specified by a position and a normal (infintie plane)
    -created relative to a timber end + direction
  -rectangular prism
    -easy for tenon ends
    -for mortises, do we use the joining timber to locate? Probably not,



Challenges:
- locating rectangular prisms from tenon and mortises
- infinet to finite bounds



:: 12/2025 timber joint rep and  timber length calculatino notes

-cut
  -substractive operation on timber
  -end cuts "set" the length of the timber (either extending it or shortening it) on the end it cut
    -ALTERNATIVE 
      -cut does not care, just does substractive cut. (this is kinda nice)
      -add suppor for infinite timbers (this is really nice)
      -unjointed end cuts can either 
        -be non infinte timber ends (a little ad-hoc)
        -we could use an end cut operation to size the timber (pro) (cumbersome, but most elegant)
  -if cutting on the bot (origin) end, the origin remains in the same place, so the final cut timber has a bottom point below 0
    -ALTERNATIVE: move origin to the very bottom always (ick?)

DECISION
  -timbers defined as is (with origin and length)
  -when a timber has a cut at the end, it becomes infinite in that direction
  -if it helps, you can think of timbers without an end cut as an infinite timber with a default end cut at the length
  
-joint
  -cuts on 1 ore more timbers that connect them


-Cut 
  -implementation detail (sorta)
  -happen at the CSG/brep level
  -if we do the extension thing
    -extending timber end includes cut
    -I guess could/should be used to infer timber length if we go with the "extension" method
  -TODO how are cuts defined, relative to timber origin or relative to a point/face on the timber?
    -maybe relative to timber, in which case a Cut class on its own is meaningless, maybe was well define TimberCut and then [TimberCut] for a list of cuts on a timber (at which point maybe just name it Cut)
-TimberCut
  -A timber with a series of Cuts on it
  -if we do the extension thing
    -has some face-cognition, meaning cuts happen relative to a face,  (this actualy only need)
      -only ends can be "extended", this is very much an ad-hoc operation
-Joint
  -a list of TimberCuts that form the joint
  -also includes joint accesories like draw bore,s fasteners, etc
-CutTimber
  -A timber with a list of TimberCuts?  


:: 11/2025 Reference Stuff

we want to introduce some kind of notion of "ReferencePoint/Line/Plane" for the purpose of positioning timbers relative to each other.
We'll call these classes "ReferenceFeature" 

For example:

I want to create 3 timbers like so:

      
      |
A-----|
  |   |
  |   |
  B   C  


so in this case, we want to use `join_timbers` and align it such that:
- the top face of timber A align with the top face of timber B
- the vertical position set above determines where it will connect with timber C



In general, we want to be able to take a ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber and position that relative to another ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber

We support the following ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber

Timber Vertex  -> ReferencePoint
Timber Edge -> ReferenceLine
Timber Face -> ReferencePlane
Timber Centerline -> ReferenceLine
Timber Face + Timber Centerline -> ReferencePoint



Lets look at the current signature of join_timbers:

def join_timbers(timber1: Timber, timber2: Timber, 
                location_on_timber1: float,
                location_on_timber2: Optional[float] = None,
                lateral_offset: float = Integer(0),
                stickout: Stickout = None,  # Defaults to Stickout.nostickout()
                size: Optional[V2] = None,
                orientation_width_vector: Optional[Direction3D] = None) -> Timber:

In this case we want to be able to do the general positioning instead of just location_on_timber1

There are some limitations since we only have 1 DOF for positioning, in particular we must position against either the Reference Plane that is the top or bottom Face of timber1
In this case, the ReferenceFeature of Timber1 also carries an implicit direction argument, but perhaps we may as well imbue Reference Features with a direction vector? The direction vector must always be perpendicular to the line/plane. 
By convention, the directional vector coming out of an vertex/edge will be perpendicular to one of the faces that the vertex/edge lives on

For the ReferenceFeature of the created timber, it could be:

ReferencePoint
ReferenceLine/Plane that is parallel with ReferencePlane of timber 1




:: 11/2025 DONE Stickout

by default, join timbers joins between midline of timbers but often we want to join from the outside, so we should add modes to the stickout class like

stickoutReference1 / stickoutReference2

enum StickoutReference = CENTER_LINE | INSIDE | OUTSIDE


CENTER_LINE
joined timber
| |
||===== createdtimber
| |

INSIDE
joined timber
| |
| |===== createdtimber
| |

OUTSIDE
joined timber
| |
|====== createdtimber
| |


Also we should probbal yrename join_timbers to refere to timber1/2 as timberA/B instead
