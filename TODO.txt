:: Reference Stuff

we want to introduce some kind of notion of "ReferencePoint/Line/Plane" for the purpose of positioning timbers relative to each other.
We'll call these classes "ReferenceFeature" 

For example:

I want to create 3 timbers like so:

      
      |
A-----|
  |   |
  |   |
  B   C  


so in this case, we want to use `join_timbers` and align it such that:
- the top face of timber A align with the top face of timber B
- the vertical position set above determines where it will connect with timber C



In general, we want to be able to take a ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber and position that relative to another ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber

We support the following ReferencePoint/Line/Plane of a timber

Timber Vertex  -> ReferencePoint
Timber Edge -> ReferenceLine
Timber Face -> ReferencePlane
Timber Centerline -> ReferenceLine
Timber Face + Timber Centerline -> ReferencePoint



Lets look at the current signature of join_timbers:

def join_timbers(timber1: Timber, timber2: Timber, location_on_timber1: float,
                stickout: Stickout, offset_from_timber1: float,
                location_on_timber2: Optional[float] = None,
                orientation_face_vector: Optional[Direction3D] = None) -> Timber:

In this case we want to be able to do the general positioning instead of just location_on_timber1

There are some limitations since we only have 1 DOF for positioning, in particular we must position against either the Reference Plane that is the top or bottom Face of timber1
In this case, the ReferenceFeature of Timber1 also carries an implicit direction argument, but perhaps we may as well imbue Reference Features with a direction vector? The direction vector must always be perpendicular to the line/plane. 
By convention, the directional vector coming out of an vertex/edge will be perpendicular to one of the faces that the vertex/edge lives on

For the ReferenceFeature of the created timber, it could be:

ReferencePoint
ReferenceLine/Plane that is parallel with ReferencePlane of timber 1



:: Stickout

by default, join timbers joins between midline of timbers but often we want to join from the outside, so we should add modes to the stickout class like

stickoutReference1 / stickoutReference2

enum StickoutReference = CENTER_LINE | INSIDE | OUTSIDE


CENTER_LINE
joined timber
| |
||===== createdtimber
| |

INSIDE
joined timber
| |
| |===== createdtimber
| |

OUTSIDE
joined timber
| |
|====== createdtimber
| |


Also we should probbal yrename join_timbers to refere to timber1/2 as timberA/B instead
