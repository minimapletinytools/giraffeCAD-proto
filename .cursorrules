# GiraffeCAD Project Rules

## Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_giraffe.py -v
```

Run specific test class:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_giraffe.py::TestFootprint -v
```

## Project Structure

- `giraffe.py` - Main timber framing CAD system
- `footprint.py` - Footprint class for 2D structure layouts
- `moothymoth.py` - Orientation and rotation matrix utilities
- `tests/` - Test suite (pytest)
- `morenotes.md` - API specification and design notes

## Key Dependencies

- `sympy` - Symbolic mathematics for exact computations
- `pytest` - Testing framework


## Coding Philosophy

- simplicity and clarity over performance!
- apart from during its initial construction, avoid using data in a mutable way
- after construction, always treat data as if it's immutable
- python is a bit of an implementation detail, I would have preferred to hav ewritten this in a functional language

## Coding Conventions

- ALWAYS use symbolic arithmetic with SymPy (Rational) 
- Vector types: V2 (2D), V3 (3D), Direction3D
- All tests must pass before committing changes
- Run tests after making changes


## Notes

- Timbers use exact symbolic computation for precision
- Footprint operates in XY plane (2D)
- See `morenotes.md` for detailed API documentation
